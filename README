This repo contains extensions to the Eigen library that provide a malloc-free pseudoinverse solver. 

Standard Eigen pseudoinverse solvers, even the in-place variants, perform heap allocation during execution.
This allocation is undesirable in certain cases, specifically in embedded systems, and so the BDCSVD class has been extended to allow for up-front allocation of all used memory (at boot, for instance),
with an ensuing malloc-free execution of the pseudoinverse solver.
